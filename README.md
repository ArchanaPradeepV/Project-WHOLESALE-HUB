WHOLESALE HUB: PURCHASE SYSTEM FOR RETAILERS

INTRODUCTION
The project Wholesale Hub is designed to streamline the operations of wholesale and retail shops by integrating product booking and availability checking functionalities. For this project a preliminary study was conducted on Colourful Textiles at Mukkam. Currently this system lacks the functionality for retailers to check out the availability of wholesale cloths in the shop. This mini project focuses on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of wholesale and retail operations by integrating key functionalities such as product booking, auto cancellation, cart, advance payment, return of product within 10 days and availability checking. This system includes auto cancellation when the customer book the cloths and did not make any further actions within 15 days which provide flexibility and up to date information for both wholesale and retail businesses. The objective of the system is to enhance efficiency of wholesale and retail operations. With this system, business can improve their inventory management, reduce cost and ultimately deliver better service to the retailers. This project will provide a scalable solution based on the needs identified by the preliminary study.
